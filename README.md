# list_pagination_and_filtering
In this project, I'll use a common web development technique known as "pagination" to enhance the usability of a web page.

Description: List Pgination and Filtering is a small web application used to paginate the lits based on the 
number of lists to be displayed on each page. In this web application, index.html file contains a list of students with details like profile image, 
name, e-mail and joning date. By using JavaScript, I paginated the lists to enhance the usability of the web application.
The pagination is implemented dynamically like if we add more student list items to the html, then 
the web application will dynamically 
create pagelinks based on the number of items to be displayed on the list.  

I have used the principle prograssive enhancement to do the project by adding the feautures one by one and testing 
them by using DevTools and also just used the plain "vanilla" JavaScript to complete the project.

Extra Credits features that I have added:
1. Used unobtrusive JavaScript to add the pagination links dynamically without adding to html.
2. Pagenation links display based on the number od search results are returned.
3. If a search has 0 results, then a message called "Sorry, no results found.." will be displayed on the webpage.
